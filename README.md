# Repository database-change-management-liquibase

This is the repository containing example code for the blog post https://blog.agilebeaver.com/database-change-management-liquibase.

In this example we will see how we can change our database schema alongside with the code changes, both maintained in the same code repository.

## Building the example

This is a small Kotlin application built with spring boot and JDK 21. The latter is the only thing you have to install to run the application.

The build system uses gradle, if you use the gradle wrapper the required version of gradle will be downloaded and installed in the project directory prior to building the application for the first time.
